        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>In this activity, we are tasked with creating two JavaScript functions: one named checkAge and the other checkVotingEligibility.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instructions: checkAge Function</li>
            <ol>
                <li>If the age is less than 13, return "You are a child."</li>
                <li>If the age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), return "You are a teenager."</li>
                <li>If the age is between 20 and 64 (inclusive), return "You are an adult."</li>
                <li>If the age is 65 or older, return "You are a senior."</li>
                <li>If the input is not a valid number, return "Please enter a valid age."</li>
            </ol>

            <li>Instructions: checkAge Function</li>
            <ol>
                <li>If the age is not a valid number (e.g., negative number or non-numeric), return "Please enter a
                    valid age."
                </li>
                <li>If isCitizen is not a boolean, return "Please specify your citizenship status."</li>
                <li>If the age is less than 18, return "You are not eligible to vote."</li>
                <li>If the age is 18 or older and isCitizen is true, return "You are eligible to vote."</li>
                <li>If the age is 18 or older and isCitizen is false, return "You must be a citizen to vote."</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
