        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>In this activity, we are assigned to answer various questions about web development, covering the technology stack used in front-end and back-end development. After that, we will write our answers on a yellow pad paper. Here are the questions we answered in this activity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and discuss essential best practices in web development, such as code optimization, security measures, and accessibility standards.</li>
            <li>Explore emerging trends and technologies in web development (e.g., Progressive Web Apps, WebAssembly). How are these trends reshaping the landscape of web development, and what opportunities do they present for developers?</li>
            <li>Explain the concept of backend development and its role in handling server-side logic and data storage.</li>
            <li>Compare and contrast different server-side technologies (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Python Django) in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of use. How do these technologies interact with frontend frameworks?</li>
            <li>Define HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and explain its role in web development.</li>
            <li>Discuss the importance of semantic markup in HTML and provide examples of semantic elements. How does semantic markup contribute to accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO)?</li>
        </ul>
