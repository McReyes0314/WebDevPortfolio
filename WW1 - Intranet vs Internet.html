        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>That matter will depend on our goal and the circumstances that we have at the moment. In situations where we require more dependable and secure information that we can share with a limited number of individuals, using the intranet is the most advantageous option. On the other hand, using the internet is the most advantageous option if we want our material to be accessible to a wide range of audiences without worrying about its security. </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Through this quiz, I learned the difference between the intranet and the internet. The internet is used to connect various networks publicly, while an intranet is more secure, as it is owned by private organizations and connects limited, selective users. On the internet, we can access a wide range of publicly available resources, whereas on an intranet, access is restricted to specific resources within the organization that owns the network.
            <br><br>I realized that there is no "most important" choice between the internet and intranetâ€”it depends on the intended use. If you need to communicate with a larger audience without prioritizing security, you would prefer the internet. However, if you need to connect privately and securely with a select group of users, you would choose an intranet.
