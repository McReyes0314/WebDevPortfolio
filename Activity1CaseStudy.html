        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Throughout this group activity, we are assigned to explore a case study and provide solutions by answering specific questions for both the front-end and back-end teams. Here are the details for our activity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Problem: The front-end team encounters issues with retrieving blog posts from the Laravel API, resulting in unexpected responses and difficulties displaying the content.</li>
            <li>Questions for Front-End: </li>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify three specific issues you might face with the API responses.</li>
                <li>Propose two debugging strategies you would use to resolve these issues.</li>
                <li>Describe how you would communicate these issues to the Back-End Team, including the information you would provide.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Questions for Back-End: </li>
            <ol>
                <li>Outline three best practices you should follow when designing the API endpoints in Laravel.</li>
                <li>Explain how you would implement error handling in your API to assist the Front-End Team in troubleshooting.</li>
                <li>Describe one testing methodology you would use to ensure that your API is functioning correctly before the Front-End Team integrates it.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>Throughout the group activity, I learned the following aspects, especially in back-end development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The best practices to follow when designing APIs, such as using "Resource-Based Routing" to ensure efficient client-server interaction through requests and responses.</li>
            <li>The importance of using built-in validation features for input validity and output formatting. This improves data consistency and reduces security vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>The significance of implementing robust error handling by providing detailed error messages and maintaining a consistent error response structure.</li>
        </ul>
